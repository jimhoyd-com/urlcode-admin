# Sequential clean-project acceptance

Run this harness with four reviewed, built local tarballs. It never publishes
packages. The output directory must not already exist; npm may need network access
for the tarballs' declared dependencies.

```sh
node scripts/clean-project-acceptance.mjs \
  --core /absolute/packages/urlcode.tgz \
  --ui /absolute/packages/urlcode-ui.tgz \
  --auth /absolute/packages/urlcode-auth.tgz \
  --admin /absolute/packages/urlcode-admin.tgz \
  --out /private/tmp/urlcode-clean-acceptance-new \
  --keep
```

The first stage installs only core and calls its shipped `initProject`. It adds a
simple application route, starts a real loopback HTTP listener and checks it. The
second stage installs UI and auth into that same npm project, renders a shared UI
page and serves it through core before activating any auth extension, adds explicitly
revision-pinned auth routes to the existing starter, and checks HTTP registration,
sign-in, account HTML and protected application access. The third stage installs
admin in place, reopens the same private SQLite database, and verifies both
accounts survived. It checks anonymous/member denial, administrator dashboard and
user/session views, revocation of member sessions, reauthentication and health.
The original route and a pre-auth project marker must survive every stage.

All modules resolve through installed compiled default exports. Source symlinks
are rejected and the subprocesses clear `NODE_OPTIONS`, so development export
conditions cannot substitute source code for packaged code. `source-manifest.json`
records each tarball SHA-256; the three `*-results.json` files record checks that
actually passed. A failure exits nonzero and leaves the directory for inspection.

`--keep` leaves the final host alive for an actual browser walkthrough. Read the
mode-0600 `browser-fixture.json` in the output directory for the loopback origin,
process ID and synthetic owner/member credentials. Open `/account/login`, sign in,
then visit `/private` and `/admin`. Stop the host with Ctrl-C or SIGTERM to its
recorded process ID. Without `--keep`, each host closes after its checks. The
fixture uses only reserved `.test` addresses and no email or provider transport.

This is a local integration fixture, not a production host or a production preset.
It uses loopback HTTP and deliberately opens password registration without email
verification to exercise the complete offline path. Its small HTTP adapter is
only for these bounded synthetic tests; production should use the reviewed host
and TLS/proxy configuration. Operator modules, encryption/CSRF keys and SQLite
remain outside `app/`. Fresh project hashes are computed for test-controlled
configuration after each stage; deployments still require explicit operator
review and approval of their project revision.

Passing does not establish live OIDC/email-provider compatibility, accessibility
conformance, recovery/soak behavior, hostile multi-tenant readiness or independent
security review. Browser observations and the exact reviewed commit/tarball hashes
should accompany the final acceptance report. Do not attach the fixture database,
keys or credentials to public issues.
